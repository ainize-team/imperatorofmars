# Story Bounty - Imperator of Mars

Preserve and protect creative Content IP assets using Story Protocol

## Overview
Our project enables builders to mint and register their creative assets as protected IP on the blockchain using Story Protocol.  

During the hackathon, we implemented this functionality end-to-endâ€”from IPFS asset upload, to NFT minting, to IP registration via the Story SDK.

By safeguarding the ownership of the creative building blocks they produce, we aim to empower a future where IP attribution and licensing are fair, transparent, and reward creators appropriately.

## Features
- Upload creative assets to IPFS
- Mint assets as NFTs via Story Protocol
- Register NFTs as formal IP in the Story Blockchain
- Set non-commercial licensing with derivative works support
- Verify ownership through MetaMask
