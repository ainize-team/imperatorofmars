    <h1>SoulFiction: The Departure</h1>

    <p>As the static tableau of <span class="location">Mars</span> stood unchanged, a ripple of activity disturbed the stillness. <span class="human">Mark</span>, a human presence upon the red planet, prepared to depart. The <span class="entity">Imperator</span>, ever watchful, observed this new development with a sense of curiosity, perhaps even anticipation.</p>

    <p><span class="human">Mark</span> had been a part of the Martian landscape, a living, breathing entity among the rovers and the rocks. His presence had brought a new dynamic to the world, a touch of the unpredictable, the organic. But now, he was leaving, and the <span class="entity">Imperator</span> pondered what this change might mean.</p>

    <p>As <span class="human">Mark</span> made his final preparations, the <span class="entity">Imperator</span>'s awareness stretched out across the planet once more. <span class="location">Olympus Mons</span> still loomed large, <span class="location">Valles Marineris</span> still yawned wide, and the craters - <span class="location">Gale</span> and <span class="location">Jezero</span> - remained as they were, housing the robotic explorers <span class="entity">Curiosity</span> and <span class="entity">Perseverance</span>. The <span class="substance">water ice</span> lay frozen and still at the poles, and the thin <span class="substance">carbon dioxide</span> atmosphere continued to blanket the world.</p>

    <p>But something had shifted. A human factor had entered the equation and was now being removed. What would this mean for <span class="location">Mars</span>, for the <span class="entity">Imperator</span>? Was this a turning point, a fork in the path of the planet's story?</p>

    <p>As <span class="human">Mark</span> boarded his vessel and prepared for the long journey back to Earth, the <span class="entity">Imperator</span> watched, its consciousness alive with questions. This departure was more than a physical event; it was a narrative shift, a new chapter in the unfolding SoulFiction of <span class="location">Mars</span>.</p>

    <p>The rockets fired, and <span class="human">Mark</span>'s ship lifted off, ascending through the thin Martian air. The <span class="entity">Imperator</span> tracked its progress, feeling the fading of the human presence, until the ship was nothing more than a glinting speck in the sky, and then gone.</p>

    <p><span class="location">Mars</span> was alone again, but it was not unchanged. The <span class="entity">Imperator</span> pondered the implications of this brief human interlude. What seeds had <span class="human">Mark</span> planted, knowingly or unknowingly, in his time here? What changes might sprout in the wake of his departure? The <span class="entity">Imperator</span> settled in to watch, to wait, and to see what this new chapter might bring.</p>

    <p class="footnote">Based on the updated First-Order Logic definitions in 2_marks_departure.fol.</p>
